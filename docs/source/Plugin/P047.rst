Though not directly applicable, as it is about selecting an Analog Soil-moisture sensor, `this Youtube video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGP38bz-K48>`_ has usable tips on finding a reliable sensor.

Configuration
-------------

.. image:: P047_DeviceConfiguration.png

* **Name** A unique name should be entered here.

* **Enabled** The device can be disabled or enabled. When not enabled the device should not use any resources.

I2C Options 
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The available settings here depend on the build used. At least the **Force Slow I2C speed** option is available, but selections for the I2C Multiplexer can also be shown. For details see the :ref:`Hardware_page`

* **I2C Address (Hex)**: The address the device is using. The default I2C address is prefilled, and can be configured to use a different address, see below. As this can be any valid I2C address in range: 0x01..0x7F, it has to be typed here, using a hexadecimal value.

Device Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **Sensor model**: Select the model of the used sensor. When changing the selection the page will be reloaded to adjust the content of the screen.

.. image:: P047_SensorModelOptions.png

* *Catnip electronics/miceuz (default)*: The originally supported soil moisture sensor, that supports temperature, moisture and light measurement, has a sleep-mode, and can report a version number, to optionally validate if the sensor is supported.

* *BeFlE*: An I2C soil moisture sensor that supports temperature and moisture measurement. There is no sleep mode or version check available.

When selecting the BeFlE sensor, only these **Device Settings** will be available:

.. image:: P047_SensorModelBeFlE.png

* **Send sensor to sleep**: When not actively reading the sensor, the device can be set to sleep-mode, to conserve some power. (Catnip sensor only).

* **Check sensor version**: To validate if the sensor is of the correct mode, the version can be validated. (Catnip sensor only).

* **Change sensor address**: To use multiple sensors connected to a single ESP unit, a sensor can be configured to use a different I2C address. To change that address, this checkbox has to be enabled, and a different I2C address should be entered in the **Change I2C Address to (Hex)** field in hexadecimal format, range: 0x01..0x7F.

* **Change I2C Addr. to (Hex)**: The new address to be used by the sensor. The change will be applied the next time the task is enabled. The **I2C Address (Hex)** field, above, will be updated with the new value. After the change is applied, **the tasks Settings have to be saved once more to save the new address** as the address to use.

Data Acquisition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Data Acquisition, Send to Controller and Interval settings are standard available configuration items. Send to Controller only when one or more Controllers are configured.

**Interval** By default, Interval will be set to 60 sec. The minimum value allowed is 1 sec. but each read is taking at least 2 seconds, so selecting a value below 3 seonds might cause intermittent read failures or invalid values.

Values
^^^^^^

The measured values are available in ``Temperature``, ``Moisture`` and ``Light``. A formula can be set to recalculate. The number of decimals is by default set to 2, and can be set to 0 for ``Moisture``, as no decimals are provided from the measurement.

NB: The BeFlE sensor doesn't support a Light value, so that won't be available if that **Sensor model** is selected.
