# ADXL345
Sparkfun's I2C/SPI Arduino Library for ADXL345

Using this Arduino Library, you have the option of using either SPI or I2C to communicate with the ADXL345.

It is fairly reasonable to use and straight forward.

You will also be able to calibrate the ADXL345 whenever necessary as shown in the example.

[*SparkFun Triple Axis Accelerometer Breakout - ADXL345*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9836)

The ADXL345 is a small, thin, low power, 3-axis MEMS accelerometer with high resolution (13-bit) measurement at up to +-16 g. Digital output data is formatted as 16-bit twos complement and is accessible through either a SPI (3- or 4-wire) or I2C digital interface.

The ADXL345 is well suited to measures the static acceleration of gravity in tilt-sensing applications, as well as dynamic acceleration resulting from motion or shock. Its high resolution (4 mg/LSB) enables measurement of inclination changes less than 1.0 degrees.

This Arduino library allows for both SPI or I2C communication. It also gives the user the ability to explore the following customizable features: tap/double tap detection, acvitivty/inactivity monitoring, and free fall detection.
