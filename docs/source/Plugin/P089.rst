Description
-----------

The Ping plugin is designed to check the availability of a local or remote device or host that can be reached via TCP/IP, and responds to ICMP requests (ping). If no response is received, the Fails counter is incremented, if the connection is restored after temporarily being disturbed, the Fails counter is auto-reset to 0.

Configuration
-------------

* **Enabled** The device can be disabled or enabled. When not enabled the device should not use any resources.

* **Hostname**: The hostname or IP-address for the device or host to monitor.

Data Acquisition

* **Interval** By default, Interval will be set to 60 sec. Every Interval setting, the host will be pinged and the state will be updated in Fails. If the ping responds as intended, then Fails is reset to 0.
