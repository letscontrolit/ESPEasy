Description
-----------

Touch pin support for ESP32.

The ESP32 does have support for 10 touch pads.
Such a touch pad can be as simple as a wire or a PCB pad connected to 
one of the GPIO pins labelled with ``T0`` ... ``T9``.

A touch pad pin can be considered as an analog input pin.
When not touched, the reported value is "High", for example 100.

When touched, the capacity of the pin increases, which in return lowers the number of charge/discharge cycles.
A typical value for a touched pin is lower than 20.

The user has to set a threshold value for when to consider a pin being touched.
The best value has to be determined by trial and error and may differ per use case.
