Plugin details
--------------

Type: |P014_type|

Name: |P014_name|

Status: |P014_status|

GitHub: |P014_github|_

Maintainer: |P014_maintainer|

Used libraries: |P014_usedlibraries|

Supported hardware
------------------

**SI7013:**
===========

Has support for humidity, temperature and ADC values 

* ± 3% RH (max), 0–80% RH  (0 to 100% RH operating range)
* ±0.4 °C (max), –10 to 85 °C (–40 to +125 °C operating range)
* Operating Voltage (1.9 to 3.6 V)
* Low Power Consumption: 150 μA active current ; 60 nA standby current
* Analog To Digital converter builtin.

Datasheet: <https://www.silabs.com/sensors/humidity/si7006-13-20-21-34/device.si7013-a20-gm1>
Direct link: <https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/data-sheets/Si7013-A20.pdf>

If using the SI7013 to measure ADC make sure you implement one of the two thermistor (thermistor can we replaced with LRD for light level measurements) circuit diagrams:
 * Figure 5. Typical Application Circuit for Thermistor Interface with AD0 = 1
 * Figure 6. Typical Application Circuit for Thermistor Interface with AD0 = 0
Do not use the single ended circuit as the Vout is connected directly to ground:
 * Figure 7. Typical Application Circuit for Single Ended 0 to 3 V Measurement (!DO NOT USE THIS CIRCUIT!)

**SI7020 and SI7021:**
======================

* Si7020: ± 4% RH (max), 0–80% RH (0 to 100% RH operating range)
* Si7021: ± 3% RH (max), 0–80% RH (0 to 100% RH operating range)
* ±0.4 °C (max), –10 to 85 °C (–40 to +125 °C operating range)
* Operating voltage (1.9 to 3.6 V)
* Low Power Consumption: 150 µA active current ; 60 nA standby current
* No ADC builtin.
  


**Note:**
The plugin reads the CHIP ID to determine if the ADC is available.

SHT20 and HTU21D devices while using the same reading protocol do not have a CHIP ID capability and not able to detect them.
