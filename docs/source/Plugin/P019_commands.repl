  ``PCFGPIO,<PCFGPIO>,<state>``

  PCFGPIO: 0 ... 255

  State:

  **2** (HIGH-Z, input)

  **1** (HIGH, output)

  **0** (LOW, output)

  **-1** (OFFLINE, disconnected)
  ","
  **Basic on/off.**.
  We can control a pin with simple http URL commands. To change the pin to high or low steady output. Setting PCFGPIO to **2** means
  that it will be able to detect low level relays (with high impedance, Z).

  "
  ``PCFGPIOtoggle,<PCFGPIO>``

  PCFGPIO: 0 ... 255

  ","
  **Toggle on/off.**.
  Toggle the current (output) state of the given PCFGPIO pin.
  When executed, it changes the pin mode to output.

  ``PCFLongPulse,<PCFGPIO>,<state>,<duration>``

  PCFGPIO: 0 ... 255

  State: 1/0

  Duration: 1 ... 999 S
  ","
  **To send a *long* pulse to a certain pin.**.
  A long pulse is basically the same as the plain pulse.  Duration is defined in seconds, which makes it more suitable for longer duration.
  This command is not blocking, but will send 2 events to start and stop the pulse. This may have some variation depending on the system load of the module.
  Variation is typically up-to 10 msec, but may be up-to a second, depending on active plugins and controllers performing blocking operations.
  "
  "
  ``PCFLongPulse_mS,<PCFGPIO>,<state>,<duration>``

  PCFGPIO: 0 ... 255

  State: 1/0

  Duration: 10 ... 15000 msec
  ","
  **To send a *long* pulse to a certain pin.**
  A ``LongPulse_mS`` is the same as the regular ``LongPulse``. The only difference is the time base in milliseconds rather than in seconds.
  "
  "
  ``PCFPulse,<PCFGPIO>,<state>,<duration>``

  PCFGPIO: 0 ... 255

  State: 1/0

  Duration: 0 ... 1000 msec
  ","
  **To send a *short* pulse to a certain pin.**
  Example to send an active high (1) pulse on PCFGPIO 14 for 500 mSeconds. Pulse duration is in milliseconds. State is 1 or 0.
  N.B. this is a blocking call, meaning no other actions will be performed during the pulse.
  "
  "
  ``Status,PCF,<PCFGPIO>``

  PCFGPIO: 0 ... 255
  ","
  **Returns the status of a pin.**
  By the use of the command you will receive the status of the relevant pin.
  "
  "
  ``Monitor,PCF,<PCFGPIO>``

  PCFGPIO: 0 ... 255
  ","
  **To monitor a PCFGPIO state.**
  By the use of the command you will receive events when the state of that pin is changed from 1 to 0 and from 0 to 1.
  "
  "
  ``UnMonitor,PCF,<PCFGPIO>``

  PCFGPIO: 0 ... 255
  ","
  **To cancel the monitor of a PCFGPIO state.**
  By the use of the command you will stop receiving events when the state of that pin is changed from 1 to 0 and from 0 to 1.
  "
  "
  ``MonitorRange,PCF,<PCFGPIO>``

  PCFGPIO: 0 ... 255
  ","
  **To monitor a PCFGPIO state.**
  By the use of the command you will receive events when the state of that pin is changed from 1 to 0 and from 0 to 1.
  "

  ``UnMonitorRange,PCF,<PCFGPIO>``

  PCFGPIO: 0 ... 255
  ","
  **To cancel the monitor of a PCFGPIO state.**
  By the use of the command you will stop receiving events when the state of that pin is changed from 1 to 0 and from 0 to 1.
