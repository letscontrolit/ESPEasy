    To modify the stock configuration without changing the EspEasy.ino file :
    1) rename this file to "Custom.h" (It is ignored by Git)
    2) define your own settings below

    You can basically ovveride ALL macro defined in ESPEasy.ino.
    Don't forget to first #undef each existing #define that you add below.
    But since this Custom.h is included before other defines are made, you don't have to undef a lot of defines.
    Here are some examples:
