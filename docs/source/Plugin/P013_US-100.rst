Introduction
------------

The US-100 is a ultrasonic distance sensor. It's able to indicate distances between 2 cm up to about 300 cm
at a resolution of about 0.3 cm.

Specifications:
 * Ultrasonic distance sensor
 * Measure angle: 30Â°
 * Ranging distance: 2cm - 300cm (some have reporting it work good up to 400 cm)


Wiring
------

The US-100 must be run on 5V. Running it with 3.3V will show very weak results or nothing at all.

.. code-block:: none

  ESP               US-100
  GPIO (X)   <-->   Trigger
  GPIO (X)   <-->   Echo (voltage divider!)

  Power
  5.0V       <-->   VCC
  GND        <-->   GND

.. warning:: Do not connect 5V directly to the ESP! Read more about :ref:`P000_Level_converter_page`.

Task settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **Device**: Name of plugin
* **Name**: Name of the task (example name **US100**)
* **Enable**: Should the task be enabled or not

Sensor
^^^^^^

* **GPIO --> Trigger**: Set the GPIO to trigger the signal.
* **GPIO --> Echo, 5V**: Set the GPIO to receive the echo signal, voltage divider is needed.
* **Mode**: ``Value`` is the most used setting, it will output the distance in centimeters.
  If you want the plugin to report a ``1`` or a ``0`` you use the ``State`` setting.
  State will open up a new field called "Threshold" which will allow you to enter
  a value. If the unit detects a value below the given threshold the task will be
  set to ``1``, if the detected value is above the given threshold the task will
  be ``0``. You should set the interval to zero in the case of using the state
  setting, just to make sure the action is triggered as soon as possible.
* **Max distance**: Set the max value the task will show. If the actual value is above the
  max distance the max distance will be displayed. Set to ``0`` will disable the max
  distance setting. Max according to the specifications is ``300`` cm.
* **Unit**: You can show the output value as imperial without the need to do it using the formula function.
* **Filter**: The signal might be a bit shaky for some applications, try to use the ``Median`` filtering
  setting in that case.


Data acquisition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **Send to controller** 1..3: Check which controller (if any) you want to publish to. All or no controller can be used.
* **Interval**: How often should the task publish its value (1..5 seconds is normal for the ``value`` setting, 0 for the ``state`` setting).

Rules examples
--------------

.. code-block::

   on US100#distance do
    if [US100#distance]<50 and [US100#distance]>45
      GPIO,14,1 //light up LED to show that you're at the correct position
    else
      GPIO,14,0
    endif
