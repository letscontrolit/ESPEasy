Description
------------

You can use a special dummy device within ESP Easy to provide additional features to the rules engine. A dummy device contains 1 (Single) to 4 (Quad) sensor values, depending on the Output Data Type selected, that can be used as variables to store custom numerical data. (floating point values, like 123.50)

The dummy device can be used like any other sensor to send it's data to a Controller. But this is not mandatory if you only want to use it within your own rules section.

The dummy device has it's own special command to set values from rules:

.. code-block:: none

  TaskValueSet <task nr/task name>,<value nr/value name>,<value|formula>

A few examples:

You run your dummy device from task number 3 and the first value should contain something calculated from a temperature sensor labeled "Outdoor":

.. code-block:: none

  TaskValueSet 3,1,[Outdoor#Temperature]-10

To make the variable to set and the task number independent, the name of the task and/or value can be used instead of the numbers. 

So for a Dummy device named ``Dummy``, Output Data Type set to Temp / Hum, and Values named ``Temp`` and ``Hum``, setting the Temperature value:

.. code-block:: none

  TaskValueSet,Dummy,temp,[Outdoor#Temperature]-10

(task name and value name are not case sensitive)

Note: You can use multiple Dummy devices if needed!
