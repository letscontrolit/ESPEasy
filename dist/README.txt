This is the distribution folder for ESPeasy.
In here you will find a flash tool to program the ESP module.

Also a number of binary images is included.

The filename is quite descriptive:
  ESP_Easy_mega-<date>_<buildType>_<chip>_<memorySize>.bin

Build type can be:  (differ in included plugins)
- normal  => Only Stable plugins and controllers
- test    => Stable + Testing, divided in various build sets to fit max. build size.
- max     => Only for ESP32 boards with large flash size, includes all plugins.

There is also a number of special builds:
- normal_IR => "Normal" + IR receiver/transmitter plugins and library
- hard_xxxxx => Special builds for some off-the-shelf hardware.
- minimal_ESP82xx_1M_OTA => Minimum number of plugins and a limited set of controllers included to be able to perform a 2-step OTA on 1 MB flash nodes.
- normal_core_xxx => "Normal" using core xxx (e.g. 2.4.1)
- normal_beta => "Normal" using the staged (beta) branch of the esp8266/Arduino repository.

Chip can be:
- ESP8266      => Most likely option  (use also for ESP8285 chips)
- ESP32        => Showing up in commercial products, but mainly seen on NodeMCU like boards.
- ESP32-S2     => Newer version of ESP32, with more GPIO pins, but lacking some features of ESP32.
- ESP32-S3     => Not yet supported in ESPEasy. (hardly available to buy)
- ESP32-C3     => Support in ESPEasy will be added soon.

MemorySize can be:
- 1M  => 1 MB flash modules (e.g. almost all Sonoff modules)
- 2M  => 2 MB flash modules (e.g. Shelly1/WROOM02)
- 4M  => 4 MB flash modules (e.g. NodeMCU/ESP32)
- 16M => 16 MB flash modules (e.g. Wemos D1 mini pro or some of the modern ESP32 boards)

Please note that the performance of 14MB SPIFFS (16M flash modules) is really slow.
All file access takes a lot longer and since the settings are also read from flash, the entire node will perform slower.
See [Arduino issue - SPIFFS file access slow on 16/14M flash config](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/issues/5932)

If these speed issues will be fixed, it is very likely the SPIFFS must then be re-partitioned, thus loosing all data in the SPIFFS.

As alternative for SPIFFS, one can chose for LittleFS.
This currently is very fast when using it, but extremely slow when storing settings as updating a part of a file is not suitable for LittleFS.
However this will be dealt with in the future.
N.B. SPIFFS and LittleFS are not compatible. Switching from one to the other will delete all existing settings and configuration stored on the file system.

Special memory partitioning:
- 2M256  => 2 MB flash modules (e.g. Shelly1/WROOM02) with 256k SPIFFS (only core 2.5.0 or newer)
- 4M316k => For ESP32 with 4MB flash, sketch size is set to 1.8 MByte (default: 1.4 MByte)
- 4M1M   => 4MB flash, 1 MB SPIFFS. Default layout for 4MB flash.
- 4M2M   => 4MB flash, 2 MB SPIFFS. Introduced in October 2019. Only possible with core 2.5.2 or newer.

Difference between .bin and .bin.gz
Starting on esp8266/Arduino core 2.7.0, it is possible to flash images that have been compressed using GZip.
Please note that this only can be used on installs already running a very recent build.
This also means we still need to update the 2-step updater to support .bin.gz files.


ESP32 now has a number of builds:
- custom_ESP32_4M316k  Build template using either the plugin set defined in ``Custom.h`` or ``tools/pio/pre_custom_esp32.py``
- test_ESP32_4M316k  Build using the "testing" set of plugins for ESP32
- test_ESP32-wrover-kit_4M316k  A build for ESP32 including build flags for the official WRover test kit.
- max_ESP32_16M1M  A build for ESP32 with larger flash size including all plugins.

ESP32 also supports Ethernet.
Ethernet support is included in similar builds as mentioned before, only ending with "_ETH" in the file name.



Since ESP32 does have its flash partitioned in several blocks, we have 2 bin files of each ESP32 build:
- test_ESP32_4M316k.bin
- test_ESP32_4M316k.factory.bin

The binary with ".factory" in the name must be flashed on a new node, via the serial interface of the board.
This flash must be started at address 0.

The binary without ".factory" can be used for OTA updates. (OTA for ESP32 is added in May 2020)


Please note that changing between those versions will destroy the settings!
The SPIFFS partition will be lost and that contains all settings.


To help recover from a bad flash, there are also blank images included.
- blank_1MB.bin
- blank_2MB.bin
- blank_4MB.bin
- blank_16MB.bin

When the wrong image is flashed, or the module behaves unstable, or is in a reboot loop,
flash these images first and then the right image for the module.

Sometimes an update performed via OTA (Over The Air) is not performing as stable as one might expect.
It is yet unclear why this happens or what may cause it.
The remedy is often to flash the same build another time via serial.
There does seem to be some correlation to bad OTA flashes and flash chips made by XMC, but it is not exclusive to this brand of flash chips.


ESP.Easy.Flasher.exe...
... is the new flashing tool for ESP Easy. You need to run it in elevated mode (as admin)
for it to fetch the COM ports correctly. If you want you may save YOUR settings using the
"Save as default settings" button in the lower left corner. If the window is too big or
too small you can experiment with the "Pixels Per Inch" variable in the
..\Settings\Default.ini file. Setting it to =96 is working for most users but the
application will try to find the most optimal value by default. Sometimes it fails to
do that. More information about the tool is found here:
https://github.com/Grovkillen/ESP_Easy_Flasher
You can also have custom serial commands entered in a txt file. One command per line.


For flashing ESP32 you need Espressif's own Flash Download Tools.
The latest version can be downloaded from: https://www.espressif.com/en/support/download/other-tools
