Introduction
------------

The ESP module can control the MP3-player module "DRPlayer Mini (DFR0299/YX5200)" and the "YX5300" module with 3.5mm output for speaker(s). Other than MP3 (sampling frequencies up to 48kHz) WAV files are also supported. The file names can be whatever but if you would like to be sure to play the correct file you should use the following name schema:

.. code-block:: none

  0000.mp3, 0001.mp3, 0002.mp3, 0003.mp3 ... 2998.mp3, 2999.mp3

Configuration
-------------

.. image:: P065_DeviceConfiguration.png

**Name** In the Name field a unique name should be entered.

**Enabled** When unchecked the plugin is not enabled.

**GPIO - RX** The GPIO pin that is wired to the player' RX pin. No information can be retrieved from the unit, so no connection to TX is needed.

**Volume** The default volume setting at startup. When using the ``vol`` command, this value will be updated, but not saved. When opening the configuration, and saving the settings, it *will* be saved though. Also, using the ``save`` command will save the setting once changed by the ``vol`` command.
