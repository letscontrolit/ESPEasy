Note that on the internet there are many temperature/humidity sensor boards with I2C available. The board above mentions SI7021, SHT21 or HTU21. These are separate microchips, check what you have bought. 
The SI7021 and SHT21 are **not** compatible. This plugin only supprts the SHT21, SHT20 and SHT25.

Description
-----------
This plugin support the SHT2x series (SHT20, SHT21, SHT25) of temperature and humidity sensors. These sensors are connected by the I2C bus.
