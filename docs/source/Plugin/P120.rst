Description
-----------

The ADXL345 Acceleration sensor can be used to detect movement of the sensor in X, Y and Z direction, also supports detection of single and double taps, and free falling detection.

This sensor is sometimes combined with an ITG3205 Gyro sensor and a HMC5883L magneto position sensor on a single board, as these sensors are often used together because of their accompanying features.
