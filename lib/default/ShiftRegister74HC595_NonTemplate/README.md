# ShiftRegister 74HC595 Arduino Library for use in ESPEasy, allowing runtime sizing without code duplication because of templating

This library simplifies the usage of shift registers. For instance, it allows to set pins of the shift register just like normal Arduino pins: 
```
sr.set(1, HIGH)
```
