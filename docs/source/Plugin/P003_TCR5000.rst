Introduction
------------

The ESP8266 module can be used as an general purpose digital pulse counter device for various digital sensors.
Think about optical sensors with a digital output. To be used for things like gas, water, electricity, door open/close counters, etc.

In this example we will connect an optical sensor. Connect the digital output to a GPIO pin on the ESP module.

Specifications:
 * IR emitter + phototransistor (for ex. water/electricity meters)
 * Distance

Task settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **Device**: Name of plugin
* **Name**: Name of the task (example name **PowerMeter**)
* **Enable**: Should the task be enabled or not

Sensor
^^^^^^

* **GPIO <-- Pulse**: Pulse input is generally set to **GPIO 14 (D5)**.
* **Debounce time**: Debounce time is generally set to **100**.
* **Counter type**: In this example the type is set to **Delta/Total/Time**.
* **Mode type**: Pulse input is generally set to **Falling**

  ``LOW`` = count when signal go from not low to low (0.8+V to 0.8-V)

  ``CHANGE`` = count on signal being changed, low to high (0.8-V to 2.4+V) or high to low (2.4+V to 0.8-V)

  ``RISING`` = count if signal is rising, from low to not low (0.8-V to 0.8+V)

  ``FALLING`` = count if signal is falling, from high to not high (2.4+V to 2.4-V)


.. warning:: GPIO 16 (D0) is not compatible with pulse counters.

Data acquisition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **Send to controller** 1..3: Check which controller (if any) you want to publish to. All or no controller can be used.
* **Interval**: How often should the task publish its value (5..15 seconds is normal).

            You might have to tweak the value to fit your application, our energy meter gives 1Wh per pulse and since
            our interval was set to 10 seconds we have to first multiply the value with ``3600`` (3600 seconds per hour) and
            also divide that value with ``10`` because we measure the Watt over a time period of 10 seconds (of that hour).

A really nice feature of SOME digital pulse counters is the small red led diode which flash for each detected pulse.
Using the adjustment wheel you can fine tune the detection level which makes the device really robust and withstand
unwanted signals from the outside. Turn the wheel until the red led light shines constantly and then turn it back
slowly until it start to detect pulses, this is the level you want to have.

It is sometimes good to mask the LED used to measure distance/pulses since the reflection could
trigger a pulse.
