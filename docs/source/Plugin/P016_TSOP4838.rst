Introduction
------------

The Communication - TSOP4838 module can be used to receive IR remote control signals. 

Connect a TSOP module, preferably a 38Khz one, preferably to GPIO with interrupt functionality.

Wiring
------

Connect the digital output (pin 1) to some chosen GPIO pin on the ESP module.

Add new received code to command lines
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

After receiving an valid IR code the code is automatically added to the following table if it not already exists.

.. note:: The code is only added automatically to line **Code nn [Hex]:**!

Execute commands
""""""""""""""""

After receiving an valid IR the command that is assigned to this code (**Code nn [Hex]:** or **Alternative code nn [Hex]:**) is executed.

Code nn [Hex]
"""""""""""""

If the received valid IR code matches this setting the **Command nn** is executed.

Alternative code nn [Hex]
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

If the received valid IR code matches this setting the **Command nn** is executed.

Command nn
""""""""""

If the received valid IR code matches the code in **Code nn [Hex]:** or **Alternative code nn [Hex]:** this command is executed.

.. note:: Up to 10 commands can be set !
