Configuration
-------------

.. image:: P044_DeviceConfiguration.png

* **Name** In the Name field a unique name should be entered.

* **Enabled** When unchecked the plugin is not enabled.

Sensor
^^^^^^

See: :ref:`SerialHelper_page`

Device Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **TCP Port**: The port for an external network client to read the data from, range 1..65535. The used port number must be unique within the device.

* **Baud Rate / Serial config**: See *Serial helper configuration*, above.

* **P1 #data event with message**: When enabled, the *P1 WiFi Gateway* Event Processing option will include the received message. **WARNING** This may easily cause memory overflow exceptions, especially when running on ESP8266 or other low-memory situations!

* **Process events without client**: By default, if no network client is connected, no serial data will be received and processed either. Enabling this option enables receiving data and generating events without a TCP client connected.

* **RX Receive timeout (mSec)**: If parts of serial data packets are somewhat delayed, but should still be handled as a single message, then the delay to wait for the next part can be configured here. 0 disables the delay.

* **Reset target after init**: Select a GPIO pin that should be pulled low once during initialization of the plugin, used to synchronize the external serial data source with the plugin.

Led
^^^

* **Led enabled**: To enable a *data is being processed* activity led.

* **Led pin**: The GPIO pin the Led is connected to.

* **Led inverted**: Iverts the on/off state for the Led.
