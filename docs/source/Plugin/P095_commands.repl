    This plugin allows dynamic configuration of the command-trigger. Available triggers are:

    * ``tft``
    * ``ili9341``
    * ``ili9342``
    * ``ili9481``
    * ``ili9486``
    * ``ili9488``

    The default trigger is ``tft``
    ","
    Some commands are postfixed with ``cmd``, indicating device specific commands. Not device-specific commands are genericly applicable to all *Adafruit Graphics* enabled devices, using the ESPEasy ``AdafruitGFX_helper`` module.

    If one of the alternative **Write Command trigger** options is selected, then also the plugin specific commands change from ``tftcmd`` to f.e. ``ili9481cmd``.
