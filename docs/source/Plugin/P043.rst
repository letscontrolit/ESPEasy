Description
-----------

Every minute the set schedule will be checked for a match, and if a value for a scheduled time is set, the GPIO will be set to that state (On/Off) when configured, or when no GPIO is configured and the value is not 0 or empty, an event is generated with the field number that caused the trigger, and another event with the set value if the Number Output Values is set to Dual or higher.

Configuration
-------------

.. image:: P043_DeviceConfiguration.png

* **Name**: Required by ESPEasy, must be unique among the list of available devices/tasks.

* **Enabled**: The device can be disabled or enabled. When not enabled the device should not use any resources.

Sensor

* **GPIO -> Clock event** Select a GPIO that will get the stated as configured for the Day,Time. When a GPIO is configured, the allowed valies for a scheduled time will be empty, Off and On only.

Device Settings

* **Nr. of Day,Time fields**: Select a number between 1 and 16 for the number of Day,Time fields to be available. Will be applied after the page is submitted. (Default: 8)

* **Value input On/Off only**: When checked, the selection for Value will be for On/Off (or empty) only, to avoid misconfiguration for less experienced users, and the Output variable response the same as if a GPIO was selected. The default is unchecked.
