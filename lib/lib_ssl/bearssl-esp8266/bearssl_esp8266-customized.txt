This library is adapted from bearssl-esp8266 to avoid conflict with the
BearSSL headers in Arduino Core.

To recreate, copy all original 'src/' and 'inc/' into 'src/' lib.

Then rename the following:
 - "bearssl with "t_bearssl
 - "inner with "t_inner
 - "config with "t_config

Add the customized files in src/:
 - t_bearssl_tasmota_config.h
 - pgmspace_bearssl.h
