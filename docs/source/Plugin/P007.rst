Plugin details
--------------

Type: |P007_type|

Name: |P007_name|

Status: |P007_status|

Used libraries: |P007_usedlibraries|

Introduction
------------

The PCF8591 is an Analog to Digital converter, connected via an I2C bus. The plugin supports to read from 1 up to 4 input values. If desired, multiple Tasks *can* be defined, addressing other, or duplicate, inputs.

Supported hardware
------------------

The chip is separately available, or on a complete module, and can be bought from several sources.

it is compatible with 3.3V logic, when powered with 3.3V, so no level converters are needed to connect it to an ESP.

Configuration
-------------

.. image:: P007_DeviceConfiguration.png

* **Name** A unique name should be entered here.

* **Enabled** The device can be disabled or enabled. When not enabled the device should not use any resources.

I2C Options 
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The available settings here depend on the build used. At least the **Force Slow I2C speed** option is available, but selections for the I2C Multiplexer can also be shown. For details see the :ref:`Hardware_page`

* **I2C Address**: The address the device is using. There are a number of addresses the module can use, and they can usually be set at the board using jumper pins.

The available options:

.. image:: P007_I2CAddressOptions.png

* **Port** As there are multiple Ports available on each board, the desired Port can be selected here.

Available options:

.. image:: P007_PortOptions.png

* **Force Slow I2C Speed** Should be **enabled**, as by PCF8591 chip specification, the I2C bus clock should be **max. 100 kHz**. This is the default **Slow device Clock Speed** I2C setting for ESPEasy (see Hardware tab). When using the default I2C Clock Speed of 400 kHz, readings will be unreliable, *especially* when reading multiple values in 1 task.

Output Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **Number Output Values** As this device supports 4 Analog inputs, the number of measurements handled by this task can be configured.

Available options:

.. image:: P007_NumberOutputValuesOptions.png

The names should speak for themselves.

When selecting f.e. the Quad option and saving the settings, the number of output values is changed to 4, resulting in these Values:

.. image:: P007_OutputValuesQuad.png

.. note::
   If Port is set to A1, A2 or A3, then the value measured from the selected **Port** will be stored in the first Values field, and any next field(s) consecutively. If **Number Output Values** is larger than the remaining number of Ports, then the remaining Values will be set to 0!

   For any 'excess' values, events *will* be generated!

Data Acquisition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This group of settings, **Single event with all values**, **Send to Controller** and **Interval** settings are standard available configuration items. Send to Controller is only visible when one or more Controllers are configured.

* **Interval** By default, Interval will be set to 60 sec. It is the frequency used to read sensor values and send these to any Controllers configured for this device.

Values
^^^^^^

The name for the value(s) is initially set to a default name, but can be changed if desired. Also, a formula can be entered to re-calculate a value before display/sending to a controller, and the number of decimals can be changed, for a Temperature, usually 1 decimal is enough to be displayed (value will be rounded).
