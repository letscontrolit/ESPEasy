//
// BACKGROUND:
// When I first received an ultrasonic sensor I was not happy with how poorly
// it worked. Quickly I realized the problem wasn't the sensor, it was the
// available ping and ultrasonic libraries causing the problem. The NewPing
// library totally fixes these problems, adds many new features, and breaths
// new life into these very affordable distance sensors. 
//
// FEATURES:
// * Works with many different ultrasonic sensors: SR04, SRF05, SRF06, DYP-ME007, URM37 & Parallax PING)))™.
// * Compatible with the entire Arduino line-up (and clones), Teensy family (including $19.80 96Mhz 32 bit Teensy 3.2) and non-AVR microcontrollers.
// * Interface with all but the SRF06 sensor using only one Arduino pin.
// * Doesn't lag for a full second if no ping/echo is received.
// * Ping sensors consistently and reliably at up to 30 times per second.
// * Timer interrupt method for event-driven sketches.
// * Built-in digital filter method ping_median() for easy error correction.
// * Uses port registers for a faster pin interface and smaller code size.
// * Allows you to set a maximum distance where pings beyond that distance are read as no ping "clear".
// * Ease of using multiple sensors (example sketch with 15 sensors).
// * More accurate distance calculation (cm, inches & uS).
// * Doesn't use pulseIn, which is slow and gives incorrect results with some ultrasonic sensor models.
// * Actively developed with features being added and bugs/issues addressed.
//
// CONSTRUCTOR:
//   NewPing sonar(trigger_pin, echo_pin [, max_cm_distance])
//     trigger_pin & echo_pin - Arduino pins connected to sensor trigger and echo.
//       NOTE: To use the same Arduino pin for trigger and echo, specify the same pin for both values.
//     max_cm_distance - [Optional] Maximum distance you wish to sense. Default=500cm.
//
// METHODS:
//   sonar.ping([max_cm_distance]) - Send a ping and get the echo time (in microseconds) as a result. [max_cm_distance] allows you to optionally set a new max distance. 
//   sonar.ping_in([max_cm_distance]) - Send a ping and get the distance in whole inches. [max_cm_distance] allows you to optionally set a new max distance.
//   sonar.ping_cm([max_cm_distance]) - Send a ping and get the distance in whole centimeters. [max_cm_distance] allows you to optionally set a new max distance.
//   sonar.ping_median(iterations [, max_cm_distance]) - Do multiple pings (default=5), discard out of range pings and return median in microseconds. [max_cm_distance] allows you to optionally set a new max distance.
//   NewPing::convert_in(echoTime) - Convert echoTime from microseconds to inches (rounds to nearest inch).
//   NewPing::convert_cm(echoTime) - Convert echoTime from microseconds to centimeters (rounds to nearest cm).
//   sonar.ping_timer(function [, max_cm_distance]) - Send a ping and call function to test if ping is complete. [max_cm_distance] allows you to optionally set a new max distance.
//   sonar.check_timer() - Check if ping has returned within the set distance limit.
//   NewPing::timer_us(frequency, function) - Call function every frequency microseconds.
//   NewPing::timer_ms(frequency, function) - Call function every frequency milliseconds.
//   NewPing::timer_stop() - Stop the timer.
//
// HISTORY:
// 01/26/2022 v1.9.4 - Added esp32 to the compatible architectures (note:
//   non-timer methods only)
// 01/20/2022 v1.9.3 - Default to disable timer methods for non-AVR
//   microcontrollers and on the ATmega4809 used in the Nano Every.
// 07/15/2018 v1.9.1 - Added support for ATtiny441 and ATtiny841
//   microcontrollers.
// 12/09/2017 v1.9.0 - Added support for the ARM-based Particle devices. If
//   other ARM-based microcontrollers adopt a similar timer method that the
//   Particle and Teensy 3.x share, support for other ARM-based microcontrollers
//   could be possible. Attempt to add to Arduino library manager. License
//   changed.
// 07/30/2016 v1.8 - Added support for non-AVR microcontrollers. For non-AVR
//   microcontrollers, advanced ping_timer() timer methods are disabled due to
//   inconsistencies or no support at all between platforms. However, standard
//   ping methods are all supported. Added new optional variable to ping(),
//   ping_in(), ping_cm(), ping_median(), and ping_timer() methods which allows
//   you to set a new maximum distance for each ping. Added support for the
//   ATmega16, ATmega32 and ATmega8535 microcontrollers. Changed convert_cm()
//   and convert_in() methods to static members. You can now call them without
//   an object. For example: cm = NewPing::convert_cm(distance);
//
// 09/29/2015 v1.7 - Removed support for the Arduino Due and Zero because
//   they're both 3.3 volt boards and are not 5 volt tolerant while the HC-SR04
//   is a 5 volt sensor.  Also, the Due and Zero don't support pin manipulation
//   compatibility via port registers which can be done (see the Teensy 3.2).
//
// 06/17/2014 v1.6 - Corrected delay between pings when using ping_median()
//   method. Added support for the URM37 sensor (must change URM37_ENABLED from
//   false to true). Added support for Arduino microcontrollers like the $20
//   32 bit ARM Cortex-M4 based Teensy 3.2. Added automatic support for the
//   Atmel ATtiny family of microcontrollers. Added timer support for the
//   ATmega8 microcontroller. Rounding disabled by default, reduces compiled
//   code size (can be turned on with ROUNDING_ENABLED switch). Added
//   TIMER_ENABLED switch to get around compile-time "__vector_7" errors when
//   using the Tone library, or you can use the toneAC, NewTone or
//   TimerFreeTone libraries: https://bitbucket.org/teckel12/arduino-toneac/
//   Other speed and compiled size optimizations.
//
// 08/15/2012 v1.5 - Added ping_median() method which does a user specified
//   number of pings (default=5) and returns the median ping in microseconds
//   (out of range pings ignored). This is a very effective digital filter.
//   Optimized for smaller compiled size (even smaller than sketches that
//   don't use a library).
//
// 07/14/2012 v1.4 - Added support for the Parallax PING)))� sensor. Interface
//   with all but the SRF06 sensor using only one Arduino pin. You can also
//   interface with the SRF06 using one pin if you install a 0.1uf capacitor
//   on the trigger and echo pins of the sensor then tie the trigger pin to
//   the Arduino pin (doesn't work with Teensy). To use the same Arduino pin
//   for trigger and echo, specify the same pin for both values. Various bug
//   fixes.
//
// 06/08/2012 v1.3 - Big feature addition, event-driven ping! Uses Timer2
//   interrupt, so be mindful of PWM or timing conflicts messing with Timer2
//   may cause (namely PWM on pins 3 & 11 on Arduino, PWM on pins 9 and 10 on
//   Mega, and Tone library). Simple to use timer interrupt functions you can
//   use in your sketches totally unrelated to ultrasonic sensors (don't use if
//   you're also using NewPing's ping_timer because both use Timer2 interrupts).
//   Loop counting ping method deleted in favor of timing ping method after
//   inconsistent results kept surfacing with the loop timing ping method.
//   Conversion to cm and inches now rounds to the nearest cm or inch. Code
//   optimized to save program space and fixed a couple minor bugs here and
//   there. Many new comments added as well as line spacing to group code
//   sections for better source readability.
//
// 05/25/2012 v1.2 - Lots of code clean-up thanks to Arduino Forum members.
//   Rebuilt the ping timing code from scratch, ditched the pulseIn code as it
//   doesn't give correct results (at least with ping sensors). The NewPing
//   library is now VERY accurate and the code was simplified as a bonus.
//   Smaller and faster code as well. Fixed some issues with very close ping
//   results when converting to inches. All functions now return 0 only when
//   there's no ping echo (out of range) and a positive value for a successful
//   ping. This can effectively be used to detect if something is out of range
//   or in-range and at what distance. Now compatible with Arduino 0023.
//
// 05/16/2012 v1.1 - Changed all I/O functions to use low-level port registers
//   for ultra-fast and lean code (saves from 174 to 394 bytes). Tested on both
//   the Arduino Uno and Teensy 2.0 but should work on all Arduino-based
//   platforms because it calls standard functions to retrieve port registers
//   and bit masks. Also made a couple minor fixes to defines.
//
// 05/15/2012 v1.0 - Initial release.
