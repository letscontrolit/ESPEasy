I2C Options 
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The available settings here depend on the build used. At least the **Force Slow I2C speed** option is available, but selections for the I2C Multiplexer can also be shown. For details see the :ref:`Hardware_page`

**I2C Address**: The address the device is using. There are a number of addresses the module can use, and they can usually be set at the board using jumper pins.

Data Acquisition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This group of settings, **Single event with all values**, **Send to Controller** and **Interval** settings are standard available configuration items. Send to Controller is only visible when one or more Controllers are configured.

**Interval** By default, Interval will be set to 60 sec. It is the frequency used to read sensor values and send these to any Controllers configured for this device.

Values
^^^^^^

The name for the value is initially set to a default name, but can be changed if desired. Also, a formula can be entered to re-calculate the value before display/sending to a controller, and the number of decimals can be changed, for Temperature, usually 1 decimal is enough to be displayed (value will be rounded).
