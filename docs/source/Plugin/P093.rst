Plugin is based on `Arduino library to control Mitsubishi Heat Pumps <https://github.com/SwiCago/HeatPump>`_.

Supported hardware
------------------

Plugin should support all Mitsubishi heat pump units with a CN105 connector:

* `P-Series <https://www.mitsubishicomfort.com/sites/default/themes/mitsubishicomfort/pdf/2018-01_P-Series_Controls-Compatibility-Chart.pdf>`_,
* `M-Series <https://www.mitsubishicomfort.com/sites/default/themes/mitsubishicomfort/pdf/2018-01_M-Series_Controls-Compatibility-Chart.pdf>`_,
* `CITY MULTI <https://www.mitsubishicomfort.com/sites/default/themes/mitsubishicomfort/pdf/Controller_Compatibility_Chart_2017-12_CITY_MULTI.pdf>`_.

Open issue, where users can report models they are using - `list <https://github.com/SwiCago/HeatPump/issues/13>`_.

How to connect
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Note**: If your unit has cn105 port, it is most likely supported. If your unit has cn100 port, it may work as well.

There is a good tutorial on how to do `soldering <https://chrdavis.github.io/hacking-a-mitsubishi-heat-pump-Part-1/#soldering>`_ and
`installing <https://chrdavis.github.io/hacking-a-mitsubishi-heat-pump-Part-1/#installing>`_.

Setup
-----

The Mitsubishi Heatpump plugin can be added as simple as selecting it from the list, selecting the serial port used for connection - and we are ready:

.. image:: P093_2.jpg

Once we hit submit, the plugin will start sending messages through controller, i.e. MQTT with payload:

``{"roomTemperature":23.0,"wideVane":"|","power":"OFF","mode":"AUTO","fan":"QUIET","vane":"AUTO","iSee":false,"temperature":24.0}``

Message is send every time a change is detected (i.e. one changes settings using IR remote control) and every X seconds, as set in the settings (60 seconds in above screenshot).
