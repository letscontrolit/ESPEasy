Similar to a smartphones "apps" the ESP Easy plugins extends the functionality of
the core operating system. You can use as many plugins as you available tasks.

List of official plugins
========================

There are different released versions of ESP Easy:

:green:`NORMAL` is the stable release, you can consider these plugins reliable and you can use these in production.

:yellow:`TESTING` (split into A/B/C/D sets) with new plugins that have not yet been fully tested and proven stable. Because of space limitations, this is split into 4 sets. When only TESTING is mentioned, the plugin is available in all TESTING builds.

.. comment :red:`DEVELOPMENT` is used for plugins that are still being developed and are not considered stable at all.

:yellow:`ENERGY` :yellow:`DISPLAY` are specialized builds holding all Energy- and Display- related plugins.

:yellow:`MAX` is the build that has all plugins that are available in the ESPEasy repository. Only available for ESP32 16MB Flash units.
