# MAX72xx LED Matrix Display Library

[![arduino-library-badge](https://www.ardu-badge.com/badge/MD_MAX72XX.svg?)](https://www.ardu-badge.com/MD_MAX72XX)

The library implements functions that allow the MAX72xx to be used for LED matrices (64 individual LEDs), allowing the programmer to use the LED matrix as a pixel device, displaying graphics elements much like any other pixel addressable display.

In this scenario, it is convenient to abstract out the concept of the hardware device and create a uniform and consistent pixel address space, with the libraries determining device and device-element address. Similarly, control of the devices is uniform and abstracted to a system level.

The library still retains flexibility for device level control, should the developer require, through the use of overloaded class methods.
