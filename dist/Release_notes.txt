      ESP32 with Ethernet or Wifi, not both at the same time configurable via Hardware Page. - ESP P2P is working - Only ETH.beginPacket() with Standard Parameter is working at the moment, configuration will follow. - Network.in not cpp/h files but this will be changed in future - Some TODO: PKR: comments will be removed in the future, too
      Removed some comments Build now working with HAS_ETHERNET not defined
      - Ethernet Commands - remove useless comments - ETH.config moved after ETH.begin - Added note: Be aware with ESPEasyP2P Network, since IP Address will change. There could be conflicts. - Ethernet JSON - Ethernet Variables
      - ETHEvents moved to WifiEvents, because they are the same type
      ESPEasyEth.ino --> ESPEasyEth.cpp/h Network.ino --> Network.cpp/h
      ESPEasyWiFi_credentials.ino --> cpp/h ESPEasyWiFi_ProcessEvent.ino --> cpp/h ESPEasyWiFi.ino --> cpp/h
      Network.h/cpp --> ESPEasyNetwork.h/cpp
      removed upload flags
      - New events: ETHERNET#Connected and ETHERNET#Disconnected
      Fixed https://travis-ci.org/github/letscontrolit/ESPEasy/builds/680698472 ci build error
      Fixed ci compile bug https://travis-ci.org/github/letscontrolit/ESPEasy/builds/680724129
      Fixed bug reported by mobremski
      - UDP / ESPEasyP2P now works for ETHERNET - Hostname Handling refactored for better overview:   - String NetworkGetHostNameFromSettings() returns Settings.getHostname()   - String NetworkCreateRFCCompliantHostname() creates a RFCcompliant Hostname from Settings.cpp   - String NetworkGetHostname() returns the Hostname prevoiusly set in ETH or Wifi dependong on Mode - MacAddress Handling refactored   - String NetworkMacAddress() returns the Mac addres of ETH or Wifi depending on Mode   - String WifiSoftAPmacAddress() returns WiFi.softAPmacAddress(mac) as String
      This String function is not needed, because there is a ETH.macAddress() which returns a String. I changed it to the byte version of the function and now uint8_t * NetworkMacAddressAsBytes(uint8_t* mac) returns either this in Ethernet mode or WiFi.macAddress(mac) in Wifi mode.
      Check changed as requested by TD-er
      addFormNote(F("Be aware with ESPEasyP2P Network, since IP Address will change. There could be conflicts.")); not used anymore because P2P UDP works good
      removede personal upload flags
      _P124_Atlas_EZO_pH.ino and _P222_Atlas_EZO_ORP.ino deleted since ther are not in ESPEasy but in Playground. There is another Issu, to put them in ESPEasy mega
      - Error in Network Name fpr WiFi fixed - logging improvements

Release date: Tue Jan  2 17:41:19 CET 2018

Edwin Eefting (27):
      more fixes for #235
      final fixes for #235, untested. all spiffs errors should be handled now and also show up in logs and webinterface
      fixed obscure crash caused by not returning a value in #235. we need to adjust compiler flags to detect these kinds of issues.
      always define PLUGIN_BUILD_NORMAL so normal plugins are compiled
      cleaned up buildflags and created common build variable
      solution for better error and warning highlighting when compiling with platformio
      enabled warnings and started fixing all the warnings to reduce the noise. (because warnings where disabled wasted about 3 hours debugging a simple no-return bug)
      cleaned up more warnings and fixed a few real bug along the way. #235
      now using PRAGMA to enable warnings, so that we dont get warnings from core libraries. also warnings will be treated as errors in Travis, this makes approving pull requests less work for me.
      travis fix
      worked around error caused by upstream libraries
      fixes
      cleaned up notification stuff. fixed #502
      warnings are treated as errors now, by travis
      refactored and added automated test stuff
      examples for the lone wanderer
      cleaner errors
      working on test stuff
      update branching info
      test library stuff
      Simple fix for MH-Z19 B version. #529
      set lcd to NULL by default. #584
      fix #588. parseTemplate() now only checks enabled taskes for [] macros
      automaticly updated release notes for v2.0.0-dev13
      release all binaries by doing the full compile step as last
      automaticly updated release notes for v2.0.0-dev13
      still trying to fix travis release scripts..
