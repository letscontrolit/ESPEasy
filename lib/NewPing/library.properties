sentence=NewPing allows interfacing with ultrasonic sensors simple, fast & powerful.
paragraph=Initially, I was not happy with how poorly ultrasonic sensors performed. I soon realized the problem was not the sensor, it was the available ping and ultrasonic libraries causing the problem. The NewPing library totally fixes these problems, adds many new features, and breathes new life into these very affordable distance sensors.
