Description
-----------

The APDS9960 sensor provides Gesture, Proximity and Ambient Light data or R/G/B color values from the light sensor, depending on the Plugin Mode. After changing the Plugin Mode, the Values arguments may need to be adjusted according to their function (Gesture, Proximity, Light or R, G, B). If the initial Values names are used, they will be replaced when switching the Plugin Mode, and the settings are actually saved.

The available settings here depend on the build used. At least the **Force Slow I2C speed** option is available, but selections for the I2C Multiplexer can also be shown. For details see the :ref:`Hardware_page`

There is only 1 I2C address available for this sensor, ``0x39`` (not shown).

The Gain, LED Drive and LED Boost parameters may need adjustment from the defaults as some of the low-cost clone sensors aren't as carefully calibrated as the original SparkFun or AdaFruit sensors. The suggested defaults are taken from the original SparkFun driver software settings. When first configuring this plugin it is advised to start with these default settings, and adjust when the sensor isn't responding as required.

For the R/G/B Colors mode, only Light Sensor Gain and Light Sensor LED Drive parameters are available. They correspond with the Ambient Light Sensor Gain and Proximity/ALS LED Drive parameters (and use the same settings storage), but with different labels.

NB: Defaults are *not* automatically set after adding the plugin!
