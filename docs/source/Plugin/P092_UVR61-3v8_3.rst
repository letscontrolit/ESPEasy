UVR61-3 (v8.3 or higher)
========================

|P092_typename|
|P092_status|

Introduction
------------

The UVR61-3 unit is a three-circuit universal control system.

The UVR61-3 unit is designed for an energy-saving and cost-effective drying of cellars and other parts of buildings by means of fan control.

The UVR61-3 three-circuit controllers has various thermostat, differential temperature and speed control functions for use in solar and heating systems, too.

* This data frame for UVR61-3 has been changed starting from firmware v8.3 or higher.
* The DL bus runs at 12 volts.
* The data frame consist of 61 bytes (excluding sync and CRC).
* The data are transmitted @ 488Hz, therefore the transmission of one data set takes about 1.3 seconds.

Setup
-----

.. note:: A new device task must be created for each value to be read from the DL bus!

Task settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **Device**: Heating - DL-Bus (Technische Alternative)
* **Name**: Name of the task (example name **ValueN**, where N is a number).
* **Enable**: Should the task be enabled or not

Sensor
^^^^^^

* **1st GPIO**: DL bus input e.g. **GPIO 14 (D5)**
* **DL-Bus Type**: **UVR61-3 (V8.3 or higher)**

.. note:: The settings for **1st GPIO** and **DL-Bus Type** must be the same for all used DL bus tasks!

Inputs
^^^^^^

.. note:: The description of the **Frame data** and the related **Frame bytes** can be found in the section **Protocol**!

Data acquisition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **Send to controller** 1..3: Check which controller (if any) you want to publish to. All or no controller can be used.
* **Interval**: How often should the task publish its value (10..60 seconds is normal).

.. note:: Interval not less than **10 seconds**! The reading of the DL bus happens twice per interval.
