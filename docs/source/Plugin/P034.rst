Device Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This device has no further configuration settings.

Data Acquisition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This group of settings, **Single event with all values**, **Send to Controller** and **Interval** settings are standard available configuration items. Send to Controller is only visible when one or more Controllers are configured.

* **Interval** By default, Interval will be set to 60 sec. It is the frequency used to read sensor values and send these to any Controllers configured for this device.

Values
^^^^^^

The names for the values are initially set to a default name, but can be changed if desired. Also, a formula can be entered to re-calculate the value before display/sending to a controller, and the number of decimals can be changed, for Temperature, usually 1 decimal is enough to be displayed (value will be rounded).
