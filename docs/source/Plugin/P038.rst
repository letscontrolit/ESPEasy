  :alt: Device configuration

* **Name** A unique name should be entered here.

* **Enabled** The device can be disabled or enabled. When not enabled the device should not use any resources.

Actuator
~~~~~~~~

* **GPIO -> DIN**: Select the GPIO pin that the LED stripe is connected to.

* **Led Count**: The number of LEDs available. This is the amount of LEDs that will be allowed for the ``NeoPixel*`` commands to be set, and that will be set using the ``NeoPixelAll*`` commands.

* **Strip Type**: Select the type of the LEDs mounted on the strip:

* **Initial brightness**: The brightness that the stripe is initially set to. Default is 0, the max. available brightness, and default before this setting was introduced. Range: 0..255.

* **Maximum allowed brightness**: The brightness that is the maximum it can be set to, either from UI or via the ``NeoPixelBright`` command, to optionally help protect both the eyes and the power-supply powering the stripe. Default is 255. Range: 1..255.

*GRB* : Most commonly, the LEDs are of GRB type.

*GRBW* : If the LEDs also support Brightness control, then the GRBW type should be selected, and the Brightness can be added in the ``NeoPixel*`` commands.
