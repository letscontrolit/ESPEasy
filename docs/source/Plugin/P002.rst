Description
-----------

The ESP82xx has 1 ADC included.
This one can be set either to measure the Vdd pin (supplied voltage to the ESP) or to ``TOUT``, so it can measure the voltage on the ``A0`` pin.

The ESP32 has 18 pins that can be used as ADC. It also has a Hall Effect sensor included.

See the `ESP32 API reference <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/peripherals/adc.html>`_ for more detailed information on the features and limitations of these pins.



Hall Effect Sensor (ESP32)
--------------------------

The ESP32 has a Hall Effect Sensor included, to measure a magnetic field.

N.B. This value can also be negative, if the polarity of the magnetic field is swapped.

Note that even the hall sensor is internal to ESP32, reading from it uses channels 0 and 3 of ADC1 (GPIO 36 and 39). 
Do not connect anything else to these pins and do not change their configuration. Otherwise it may affect the measurement of low value signal from the sensor.


WiFi activity and ADC
---------------------

The ADC on the ESP8266 is also used during WiFi RF calibration.
This can result in incorrect readings of the ADC while a WiFi connection attempt is in progress.

ESP32 has 2 ADCs present.
``ADC1`` and ``ADC2``

Since the ``ADC2`` is shared with the WIFI module, which has higher priority, reading operation of ``adc2_get_raw()`` may fail between ``esp_wifi_start()`` and ``esp_wifi_stop()``.


Oversampling
------------

When ``Oversampling`` is enabled, the plugin will take a reading 10 times a second.
This reading is averaged over the entire interval time as set in the task configuration.

The highest and lowest values are subtracted from the recorded values, to filter out single flukes.
Measured values which are clipped either on the lower range or higher range are only added once per interval as they may occur for more than a single sample per interval.
This is done to prevent a relative large offset in the averaging due to clipping or maybe unforceen interaction of the WiFi chip on the ADC measurements.


Calibration
-----------

The plugin supports a 2-point calibration.
The user can set these to convert the raw values into the desired unit of measure.
When set, the configuration screen also displays the minimum, maximum and step size values based on the calibration settings.
