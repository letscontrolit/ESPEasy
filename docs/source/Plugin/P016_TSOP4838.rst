Introduction
------------

The Communication - TSOP4838 module can be used to receive IR remote control signals. 

Connect a TSOP module, preferably a 38Khz one, preferably to GPIO with interrupt functionality.

Wiring
------

Connect the digital output (pin 1) to some chosen GPIO pin on the ESP module.

Load the firmware and follow the firmware specific instructions.

A datasheet for the TSOP4838 receiver can be found here: http://www.vishay.com/docs/82459/tsop48.pdf.

Task settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **Device**: Communication - TSOP4838
* **Name**: Name of the task (example name **IR**).
* **Enable**: Should the task be enabled or not

Sensor
^^^^^^

* **Sensor**: standard definition for a GPIO pin setting

Content

Add new received code to command lines
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

After receiving a valid IR code the code is automatically added to the following table if it not already exists.

Execute commands
""""""""""""""""

After receiving a valid IR the command that is assigned to this code (**Code [Hex]** or **Alt. Code [Hex]**) is executed.

Inhibit time for the same command [ms]
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The time that a same command will be ignored if receiving it multiple times. When set too high, often repeated commands like volume-up or volume-down will respond slower than expected.

.. note:: The code is only added automatically to field **Code [Hex]**!

Code - command map
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Decode type
""""""""""""

The type as detected by the receiver, the list contains all supported types.

Repeat
""""""

If a repeat code is detected, this is checked.

Code [Hex]
"""""""""""""

If the received valid IR code matches this setting the **Command nn** is executed.

Alt. Decode type
""""""""""""""""

The type as detected by the receiver, the list contains all supported types.

Repeat
""""""

If a repeat code is detected, this is checked.

Alt. Code [Hex]
"""""""""""""""

If the received valid IR code matches this setting the **Command nn** is executed.

Command nn
""""""""""

If the received valid IR code matches the code in **Code [Hex]** or **Alt. Code [Hex]** this command is executed.

.. note:: Up to 10 commands can be set !
